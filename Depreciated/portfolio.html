                <h4>Intern Mechanical Designer - Summer 2014</h4>
                <p>
                I spent summer 2014 working at Teague as an intern mechanical designer. I had an awesome time, and learned a lot about the aviation industry in the process. I learned how to embrace CATIA runtime errors, and how to work as a larger engineering initiative. In fact, working for Teague was one of my lifetime goals, as I have always loved to design things and love airplanes. Looks like I got started early on the bucket list huh? I learned a lot at Teague, and loved every moment of it. To take a look at my (largely redacted) presentation on my summer, click the button below.</p>

                <h3>Linear Haptic Prototype</h3>
                <h4>TEAGUE, Intern Mechanical Designer - Summer 2014</h4>
                <p>
                The linear haptic device was an interesting project, as it had only been developed on the whiteboard. No physical or digital concepts existed. The project was purely up to my imagination, with a goal to design and produce revision one by the end of the summer. The linear haptic device in its purest form is a customizable module to be placed in aircraft mockups. It actuates a force which mimics latches, buttons and more, all customized to a clients needs. Designed in CATIA V5 with touchups and renderings in SolidWorks.</p>

                <h3>Cooling Ducting</h3>
                <h4>UW Formula Motorsports - Team 25</h4>
                <p>The cooling ducting is an important albeit overlooked portion of an FSAE Racecar. Taking high velocity, low pressure flow and redirecting to low velocity high pressure flow allows for cooling of the radiator, and by extension the engine. Designed and analyzed in one academic quarter, using SolidWorks, ANSYS FLUENT and Star-CCM+. Manufactured using a MultiCam 3 axis router, and HSMWorks. Final parts were manufactured using dry layup molds and Torray T700 multiweave. Unfortunately due to the highly competitive nature of the competition, I have to remain tight lipped about many aspects of the design. However, I'm always happy to discuss the project one on one, just contact me. </p>

                <p>A culmination of knowledge learned in one quarter at the University of Washington. Included creation of full assembly with exploded view, drawings and two renders. My knowledge has surely improved since then, but demonstrates ability to produce a true-to-form design without technical information.

                <h4>University of Washington</h4>
                <p>I have recently begun participating in the Design, Build, Fly team at the University of Washington. DBF is an aeronautics student group designing and building a small scale UAV. This summer the team will venture to the AIAA sponsored competition, where the UAV will perform a series of tasks including payload transport and an obsticle course. Currently I work with flight testing, making sure the aircraft is performing up to par with our expectations, and can in return place well at competition. Specifically, I will soon be working to integrate a flight telemetry package into our UAV. This is very exciting and will allow us to have an eye in the sky, seeing data from our craft in real time! </p>
